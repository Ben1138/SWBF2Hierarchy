## SWBF2 Hierarchy
This is a tool to plot the hierarchy of all entity classes, defined in all given *.lvl files.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>

<br/>
These small examples are chosen on purpose, since classes like "soldier" for example produce a far more nested hierarchy with lots of nodes.

## Build requirements
